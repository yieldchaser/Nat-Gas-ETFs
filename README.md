# Nat Gas ETF Volume Monitor

A real-time dashboard for tracking volume flow and price-volume dynamics across natural gas ETFs. Combines daily pipeline data from Yahoo Finance and TrackInsight with a multi-timeframe volatility engine to surface statistically significant volume and capital flow events.

**Live Dashboard:** [https://yieldchaser.github.io/Nat-Gas-ETFs/](https://yieldchaser.github.io/Nat-Gas-ETFs/)

## Overview

This project implements four interconnected analytical engines:

1. **Volume Monitor** (`index.html`) — Multi-timeframe volume anomaly detection, volatility modeling, and conviction event filtering across 6 leveraged ETFs.
2. **Flow Monitor** (`flows.html`) — Daily capital flow tracking (AUM in/out), Z-Score history, pressure scoring, divergence detection, and cross-ETF comparison.
3. **Trough-to-Peak Analyzer** (`trough-peak.html`) — Parameterized ZigZag recovery cycle identification with micro-analytics and forward-return context.
4. **Vol Regime Monitor** (embedded in `trough-peak.html`) — Full-lifetime historical volatility chart (5D/21D/63D/252D HV) with regime classification, crosshair tooltips, measurement tool, and side-by-side pair comparison.

## Instruments Tracked

**LONG SIDE** (Bull — profit when Nat Gas rises):
- **BOIL** – ProShares Ultra Bloomberg NG (2×, NYSE)
- **HNU.TO** – BetaPro Natural Gas 2× Bull (2×, TSX)
- **3NGL.L** – WisdomTree NG 3× Daily Long (3×, LSE)

**SHORT SIDE — Primary signal anchor** (Bear — profit when Nat Gas falls):
- **KOLD** – ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg NG (2× inverse, NYSE)
- **HND.TO** – BetaPro Natural Gas 2× Bear (2× inverse, TSX)
- **3NGS.L** – WisdomTree NG 3× Daily Short (3× inverse, LSE)

> Short ETF trough volume spikes are the strongest and most reliable turning-point signal in this system. Statistical validation across n=166 cycles: volume spikes at short ETF price troughs at median 1.55× baseline (z=5.4). A short ETF price trough = gas price peak candidate.

**Underlying futures context:**
- **NG=F** – NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures (signal gate only — not traded)

> **Color convention across all dashboards:** For SHORT ETFs, color is semantically inverted — outflows (−) are shown green (bullish: shorts being unwound) and inflows (+) are shown red (bearish: new short entries). Long ETFs follow the standard convention.

## Dashboard Pages

### 1. Flow Monitor (`flows.html`)

Tracks daily capital inflows and outflows (AUM changes) across all 6 ETFs via TrackInsight data. Identifies stealth accumulation, distribution events, and divergences between price and capital flow.

#### Cross-ETF Sentiment Banner

A split bar showing the balance of 30-day capital flows between long and short sides:
- **Left (green)** — long-side flow share (BOIL + HNU + 3NGL). Inflows = bullish.
- **Right (red)** — short-side flow share (KOLD + HND + 3NGS). Outflows = bullish (shorts unwinding).
- Sub-labels explain direction: *"Shorts being unwound"* vs *"Short entries rising"*.
- Overall sentiment badge: `BULLISH` / `BEARISH` / `NEUTRAL`.

#### KPI Flow Cards (Long & Short Side)

Compact cards — one per ETF — show at a glance:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **30D Net Flow** | Total net capital movement over 30 trading days |
| **Z-Score** | How unusual today's flow is vs. the 30-day rolling average |
| **5D / 20D Momentum** | Rolling short- and medium-term net flow |
| **Regime** | `ACCUMULATION` (Z > +1.5) / `DISTRIBUTION` (Z < −1.5) / `BALANCED` |
| **Pressure Score** | Composite −100→+100: Z-Score (25pts) + momentum factor + consecutive-streak bonus. Displayed with a mini fill bar. |

All color logic is side-aware: short ETF cards invert green/red to reflect bullish/bearish meaning for Nat Gas price.

Clicking any card loads that ETF in the Deep Dive panel.

#### Deep Dive Chart Panel

Select any ETF + time range (1W / 1M / 3M / 6M / 1Y / 3Y / ALL). Contains:

1. **Cumulative Flow + Price chart** — Split-adjusted NAV price (white line) overlaid with cumulative net flow area (green = net inflows, red = net outflows from the visible range start). Drag to measure price and flow changes between two dates.
2. **Global Range Slider** — Immediately below the top chart. Controls the zoom of **all charts on the page simultaneously** (cumulative chart, daily bars, Z-Score history, cross-ETF comparison). Scroll-wheel zoom also syncs.
3. **Daily Flow Bars** — Green bars above zero = inflow days; red bars below = outflow days.
4. **Stats Row** — Bottom of panel: Z-Score, 5D/20D momentum, Regime, Pressure for the active ETF.

#### Flow vs Price Divergence Table

Scans the active ETF's history for windows (3d / 5d / 10d) where price and flow moved in opposite directions by meaningful thresholds:

- **Bullish Divergence** — Price fell >3% but net flow was positive (stealth accumulation).
- **Bearish Divergence** — Price rose >3% but net flow was negative (distribution behind the rally).

Filterable by lookback (90D / 6M / 1Y / ALL). Right-aligned numeric columns, alternating row tints.

Each divergence is defined as an event window `[s, e]` where `s = e − w + 1` (window start) and `e` is the end date, for `w` ∈ {3, 5, 10}.

**Context flow columns:**

| Column | Window | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **LOCAL AVG** | `s−3` → `e+3` (`w+6` days total) | Broad local context spanning 3 days before the window opens through 3 days after it closes. Length varies by `w` (9 days for 3d, 11 for 5d, 16 for 10d). Shows `—` when insufficient future data exist. |
| **PRE-3D** | `s−3` → `s−1` (3 days) | Average daily flow in the 3 days immediately before the window opens. No overlap with the event window — cleanly shows whether the imbalance was already building before the divergence started. |
| **POST-3D** | `e+1` → `e+3` (3 days) | Average daily flow in the 3 days after the window closes. Measures follow-through — did capital continue or reverse? Shows `—` for the most recent events. |
| **DAY FLOW** | `e` only | Net flow on the exact end-date. Distinct from AVG/DAY (full-window average); isolates whether the final day itself spiked or was ordinary. |
| **BASE-30D** | `s−30` → `s−1` (30 days) | Prevailing flow regime before the divergence window opened. Computed as `(cumulative_flow[s−1] − cumulative_flow[s−31]) ÷ 30`. Compare PRE-3D and AVG/DAY against this to judge whether the divergence is truly anomalous. Shows `—` when fewer than 30 days of history precede the window. |

#### Flow Z-Score History Chart

Full historical chart of the rolling flow Z-Score with:
- Green shaded zone above +1.5σ (Accumulation)
- Red shaded zone below −1.5σ (Distribution)
- Zone labels right-aligned at chart edge
- Hover crosshair with date, Z-Score, daily flow, and regime tooltip
- Controlled by the global range slider

#### Cross-ETF Cumulative Flow Comparison

Overlaid cumulative flow lines for all 6 ETFs (normalized to zero at start of visible range). Features:
- ETF toggle chips (click to show/hide individual ETFs)
- Filter by side: ALL / LONG / SHORT
- HTML legend below the chart (no canvas overlap or label collision)
- Active ETF highlighted with thicker line and bold legend entry
- Hover crosshair showing all visible ETF values at any date
- Controlled by the global range slider

#### Yearly Flow Activity Matrix

Heatmap-style table showing the count of significant flow events (|Z-Score| ≥ 1.5) per year per ETF, alongside average Z-Score magnitude. Useful for identifying which years had the most active capital flow signals.

### 2. Volume Monitor (`index.html`)

Multi-timeframe volume anomaly detection engine:

- **Detects volume anomalies** across 6 windows (5d/10d/21d/63d/126d/252d) using percentile ranking and Z-scores
- **Models volatility** with HV, vol regime percentiles, ATR, and VoV
- **Synthesizes signals** via the **VPS (Volume Pressure Score)** — a 5-component composite
- **Tracks historical echoes** — patterns showing price action following capitulation signals, with lead-time calibration and regime-stratified forward returns
- **Monitors capitulation** with **VCVI** (Vol-Adjusted Capitulation Volume Index)
- **Detects weather spikes** via 5d fast-window VCVI + ATR sharp-spike flag
- **Gates signals** with a seasonally-adjusted NG=F price Z-score
- **Corrects for leveraged ETF decay** to prevent structural price drift contaminating percentile signals
- **Weights by season** (winter ×1.3, summer ×0.85)
- **Classifies NG=F volatility regime** (normal / elevated / extreme)

#### ETF Cards

Each card shows:

1. Price & daily change, season badge, ⚡ SPIKE badge
2. Volume metrics: RVOL-21d, Z-Score, VROC-10d
3. Volume percentile bars: 6 timeframes (5/10/21/63/126/252d)
4. Volatility panel: HV-10/21/63d, vol regime, ATR-14, term structure, VoV-21
5. VCVI indicators: 5d fast, 21d (with decay-corrected †value), 63d
6. VPS composite score + MWCA alarm

#### Top-of-Page Convergence Flash Banner

When all 3 ETFs on either side spike within a 10-calendar-day window (SWVC `CONVERGED` state), a full-width pulsing banner appears **immediately below the header** — visible without scrolling:

- **RED** (short-side convergence): `⚡ SHORT SIDE CONVERGED — ↓ SHORT / INVERSE SETUP — gas TOP candidate`
- **GREEN** (long-side convergence): `⚡ LONG SIDE CONVERGED — ↑ LONG / LEVERAGED SETUP — gas BOTTOM candidate`

Each banner shows the individual ETF spike dates, days-ago, and RVOL levels inline. Hidden entirely when no convergence is active — zero noise on normal days.

#### Signal Column Layout (top to bottom)

Panels are ordered by signal priority:

1. **NG=F Price Context Bar** — seasonal Z-score gate (always visible)
2. **Conviction Events** — strictest filter, shown first as the primary actionable signal
3. **Elevated Watch** — softer pre-conviction filter
4. **Active Alerts** — real-time feed (VCVI, MWCA, RVOL only — see below)
5. **Stress Matrix** — per-pair IPSI, vol regime, status
6. **Side-Wide Convergence (SWVC)** — cross-market tri-ETF spike tracker
7. **Historical Echoes** — base-rate forward returns for past VCVI signals
8. **Volume Heat Calendar** — 90-day volume heatmap
9. **Multi-Window Convergence** — gauges across all 6 timeframes

#### Active Alerts

The alert feed fires on three signals only — all directly test the trough/peak volume spike hypothesis:

| Alert | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| **VCVI** | VCVI-21d ≥ 55 (watch) / 72 (critical) / 88 (extreme) |
| **MWCA** | Volume ≥ 90th pct across **all 6 windows simultaneously** |
| **RVOL** | 21d relative volume ≥ 1.5× (elevated) up to ≥ 5.0× (extreme) |

CVI, VPS, ATR breakout, VoV-21, and vol-regime warnings are computed and visible on ETF cards but do not fire alerts — they were removed from the alert feed to reduce noise.

#### Signal Command Center

**NG=F Price Context Bar** — Seasonal Z-score gate:

| Gate | Condition | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **LONG ✓** | Seasonal z ≤ −1.5σ | Gas anomalously cheap for the month → long signals credible |
| **SHORT ✓** | Seasonal z ≥ +1.5σ | Gas anomalously expensive → short signals credible |
| **Both ✗** | −1.5 < z < +1.5 | Gas within seasonal norm → interpret with caution |

**Volatility Regime Badge:**

| Regime | Trigger | Behavior |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **● NORMAL** | Price ≤ $4.5, \|z\| < 1.5σ, NG HV < 70th pct | Signals behave as expected |
| **⚠ ELEVATED** | Price > $4.5 OR \|z\| ≥ 1.5σ OR HV ≥ 70th pct | Interpret with caution |
| **🚨 EXTREME** | Price > $7.0 OR \|z\| ≥ 2.5σ OR HV ≥ 90th pct | Outlier environment — historical patterns may invert |

**Conviction Events (5-gate filter, ~1–2/ETF/year):**

| Gate | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| 1 — Volume Capitulation | VCVI-21d ≥ 72 (or Extreme Override) |
| 2 — Multi-Window Breadth | ≥ 3 of 5 windows ≥ 85th pct |
| 3 — Price Dislocation | \|Daily move\| > 1.5× ATR-14 |
| 4 — Regime Context | Vol regime ≤ 70th percentile |
| 5 — NG Directional | Long: z ≤ −0.5σ · Short: z ≥ +0.2σ |

**Elevated Watch (3-gate, ~4–8/ETF/year):** softer thresholds (VCVI ≥ 60, 2/75 breadth, 1.2× ATR), no vol-regime constraint.

**Side-Wide Volume Convergence (SWVC):** scans the last 15 trading days for each of the 3 ETFs on a side. If all 3 hit RVOL ≥ 2× within any rolling 10-calendar-day window — even on different days — the side is marked `CONVERGED`. Spikes staggered 2–5 days apart across US/CA/UK exchanges fully qualify. Status ladder: `CONVERGED` → `PARTIAL` (2–3 ETFs, or all 3 outside window) → `SINGLE` → `QUIET`. When converged, the top-of-page flash banner fires automatically.

**Historical Echoes:** forward return study (5/10/21/42/63/126/252d windows) for all past VCVI ≥ 55 signals, with median lead-time to peak, season tags, regime-stratified return tables.

**HV Stat Boxes (per instrument):**

| Window | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **5D HV** | Ultra-short spike detector — catches weather events before 21D registers |
| **21D HV** | Monthly baseline — primary regime signal, standard for ETF sizing |
| **63D HV** | Seasonal-quarter — aligns with NG injection/withdrawal cycles |
| **252D HV** | Annual baseline — full NG seasonal cycle reference |

Each box shows the annualised HV %, its percentile vs full available history, and a colour-coded regime pip.

**Chart features (matching Price & Cycle Map):**
- Interactive multi-selection: Toggle any combination of 5D, 21D, 63D, and 252D HV series to view them overlaid
- Full-lifetime HV line charts (3,300–4,500+ sessions depending on ETF) dynamically color-segmented by their respective regime percentiles
- Background regime zones (Low / Normal / Elevated / Spike)
- Area-fill gradient under the primary selected line
- 5-level evenly-spaced Y-axis grid with left-side HV% labels
- Right-side percentile threshold labels (p25 / p75 / p90)
- X-axis date labels — adaptive to zoom: daily (≤14 bars), weekly (≤35), biweekly (≤65), monthly, or yearly-boundary mode
- Vertical grid lines from every x-axis tick
- **Crosshair + hover tooltip** — vertical dashed line, dot on line, floating card with date / HV-21 / daily change
- **Click-drag measurement tool** — tinted band + card showing HV Δ and date range
- **Horizon quick-range buttons** (1W / 1M / 3M / 6M / 1Y / ALL)
- **Dual range-slider brush** — label shows actual start–end date strings
- Current-value pulse dot (when viewing latest data)

**Footer stats (per card):**
- **TERM STRUCT** — 5D/63D HV ratio; flags when near-term vol is accelerating (>1.35×)
- **VoV-21** — Vol-of-vol (std of rolling HV-10 over 21 days); STABLE / MODERATE / SHIFTING / UNSTABLE
- **EFF VOL N×** — HV-21 × leverage multiplier; realistic annual swing band

**Regime classification:**

| Label | Percentile | Colour |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| LOW | < 25th | Blue |
| NORMAL | 25–75th | Green |
| ELEVATED | 75–90th | Orange |
| SPIKE | ≥ 90th | Red |

Percentiles computed against the full available history for each instrument.

### Data Flow

**Volume pipeline (nightly via GitHub Actions):**
1. Fetch full-lifetime OHLCV for 6 ETFs + NG=F via Yahoo Finance (3,300–4,500+ sessions per ETF, back to 2008–2012 depending on listing date)
2. Compute NG=F context: seasonal Z-score, HV percentile, regime series
3. Compute per-ETF: volume metrics (6 windows), volatility, CVI/VCVI, VPS, decay-adj
4. Detect conviction events (5-gate + extreme override + momentum guard)
5. Detect elevated watch events (3-gate)
6. Generate historical echoes with regime-stratified forward return tables
7. Write `dashboard_data.json` + `latest_signals.json` → sync to `docs/data/`

> Full-lifetime history is stored (not capped at 252 days) so the Vol Regime Monitor can render complete HV sparklines from each ETF's inception date, and percentile rankings are computed against the full available record.

**Flow pipeline (nightly via GitHub Actions):**
1. Fetch daily AUM snapshots for all 6 ETFs from TrackInsight
2. Parse USD flow, NAV, and daily performance from snapshot fields
3. Compute cumulative flow, 30-day rolling Z-Score, 5D/20D momentum
4. Classify regime per day (Accumulation / Distribution / Balanced)
5. Compute pressure score (Z + momentum + streak bonus, clamped ±100)
6. Aggregate cross-ETF sentiment (bull vs bear 30d net flows, BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL)
7. Write per-ticker JSON + summary JSON → sync to `docs/data/flows/`
